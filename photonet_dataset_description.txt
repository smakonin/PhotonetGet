Description of columns of photonet_dataset.txt
----------------------------------------------

Column 1: Index
Column 2: Photo-ID 
Column 3: Number of aesthetics ratings received
Column 4: Mean of ratings
Column 5: Standard Deviation of ratings
Columns 6-12: Distribution (counts) of aesthetics ratings in 1-7 scale, 6 being for 1, and 12 being for 7.
   
NOTE: In a few cases, only the mean was available, the individual ratings were not available. In these cases, only the mean should be used. Columns 5 to 12 will be -1 in these cases. If your model involves distributions or std. dev. of ratings, please handle these cases as appropriate.


How to obtain the original images?
----------------------------------

The photo ID is unique, but the exact URL of the files may change on the Photo.net server. Probably the best way to obtain the image URL is to download/wget the html page hosting the image, and scrape that html file for the image URL (there is usually a pattern that can be easily detected). The URLs for the html pages are currently of the following form:

    http://photo.net/photodb/photo?photo_id=<Photo-ID>
e.g.,
    http://photo.net/photodb/photo?photo_id=1008958

Instead of doing the above, at the time of this release, the images can be downloaded directly from URLs of the following form:

    http://gallery.photo.net/photo/<Photo-ID>-md.jpg
e.g.,
    http://gallery.photo.net/photo/1008958-md.jpg
    


Copyright Issues
----------------

Please respect copyright that applies to you and to the data sources. Please do not re-distribute the image data. This is the same reason we do not distribute the original images.
